   <h2> Welcome to My Page! </h2>
       <p> This website has the links to all of the Javascripts programs that I have created during my time in my CSC 106 class. 
       when you click on the links you can see the different programs and what each one is. Throughout the class I have grown as a programmer
       and these programs shoow that.</p>
