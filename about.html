  <h1>All About Me</h1>
     
   <h2> Welcome to My Page! </h2>
       <p> My name is Amelia Vogel. I am a sophmore at the University of Rhode Island and I am going for a criminal justice major with a possible digital forensics minor.<br>
     I am in CSC 106 and this is my first time programming and I am excited to learn more about it and grow my skills. I enjoy going to the gym and staying active as well <br>
     as hanging out with my friends, as well as going to the beach. I am a part of Best Buddies and SOLC on campus and am always excited to try new things. I have a golden <br>
     retriever that is almost two years old. I also have two siblings, a younger brother and a younger sister.
