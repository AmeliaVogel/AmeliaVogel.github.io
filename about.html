       <p> My name is Amelia Vogel. I am a sophmore at the University of Rhode Island and I am going for a criminal justice major with a possible digital forensics minor.
     I am in CSC 106 and this is my first time programming and I am excited to learn more about it and grow my skills. I enjoy going to the gym and staying active as well 
     as hanging out with my friends, as well as going to the beach. I am a part of Best Buddies and SOLC on campus and am always excited to try new things. I have a golden 
     retriever that is almost two years old.I am also a facilitator at the North Woods Challenge Course here at URI. I also have two siblings, a younger brother and a younger sister. 
     My favorite movies are Baywatch, Jumanji, The Greatest Showman, etc. I love watching The Office and New Girl as they are some of my favorite shows
          and I watch them all the time.
