  <h1>Final Project</h1>
     
   <h2> Welcome to My Page! </h2>
          
       <p> For CSC 106 I completed a final project with my partner Yusra. We created a spinoff of pacman call pacmoji however, instead of trying to get all of the dots while not being caught by the ghosts; here you are trying to get 30 points in 30 seconds. 
          There are 3 gems and 2 bitmoji pairs on the screen and your job is to move your character using the up, down, left, and right keys through the space inside the walls to get the needed points. The gems are worth 1 point while the bitmojis are worth 2 points. 
          The trick here is that the gems and bitmojis aren't stationary, they are constantly moving around the screen, the bitmojis moving faster than the gems, and you need to chase after them to get points. When starting the game there is an introduction 
          screen that says what the game is and shows the characters of the game and when you click start it takes you to a screen where you can choose what character you want to be. There are 3 choices to choose from and once you select your character it will
          tell you to press start. Once the game is started you have 30 seconds to get 30 points and win the game. You can move your character up, down, left, right however it can't go through walls you have to go around them.
