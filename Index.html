 <h3> Welcome to My Page! </h2>
       <p> This website has all of the programming that I did in my csc 106 class, and shows my progression as a programmer. If you click on the Javascripts button, that'll take you to 
          the page where the javascripts programs that I have created. The apps button on the home page takes you t4o where the apps that I have
          programmed and created will be available to view here. The about me page is where you can find information about me.
